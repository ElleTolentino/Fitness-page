            <h2>Online Training</h2>
            <p>Mostly because of the pandemic, people realized it is much more cost-effective, time-saving and flexible to train in your own home with an expert trainer of your choice. After you are done, just hop in the shower and some clean clothes, not to mention your own kitchen is just a step away!</p>
